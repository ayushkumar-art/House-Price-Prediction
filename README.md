# 🏡 Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the selling prices of houses based on various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, furnishing status, and more. It demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project contains the following key files:

`train.csv` is the training dataset with features and the target variable (price).  
`test.csv` contains the testing data for which the prices need to be predicted.  
`submission.csv` is the sample format for submitting predicted results.  
`Housing_Prediction_full.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that implements the entire workflow.  
`README.md` is the documentation file you are reading now.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset provides structured information about house properties. It includes features like Area, Location, Number of Bedrooms, Parking Availability, Furnishing Status, Transaction Type, and Per Sqft Price. The target variable is the actual house price.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

The project begins with cleaning and preprocessing the data, where missing values are handled, categorical columns are encoded, and outliers are addressed.

This is followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and relationships within the data. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and heatmaps are used to gain insights.

Next, several regression models are trained and evaluated, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, and Random Forest Regressor. Performance is measured using metrics such as R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Finally, the best-performing model is used to make predictions on the test data, and the results are exported in the required format.

## 📌 Results and Insights

The Random Forest Regressor outperformed other models in terms of accuracy and consistency.  
Area, Location, and Per Sqft Price emerged as the most influential features for predicting house prices.  
The project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to real estate pricing.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

This project can be further improved by experimenting with advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM.  
A user interface can be created using Streamlit or Flask to make predictions in real-time.  
Integration of map-based and location-aware features (like distance to city center) can enhance prediction accuracy.
