🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a regression model that can predict the selling price of a house using various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, etc. The notebook demonstrates a full pipeline from data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and prediction.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

NumPy & Pandas

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository or download the files.

Open the Housing_Prediction_full.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Run the cells step-by-step to train the model and generate predictions.

📈 Results
The model achieved a reasonable prediction accuracy based on training and validation data.

Random Forest performed better among all models tested.

✅ Future Improvements
Implement advanced regression techniques (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit

Use location-specific features (e.g., geocoding, map data)
